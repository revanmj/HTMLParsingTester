Simple app for testing of data extraction from websites using Jsoup parser and regular expressions.

It lets you enter a query (Jsoup selector) and optionally chose an attribute from which value should be extracted. In case of regular expressions, it allows you to enter a regex and then shows value etracted from the first group (support for many groups is coming soon).

App is using Jsoup 1.8.1.
